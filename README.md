Form a group of 5 members. Sign-up in one of the groups that I've made in the Blackboard "Groups" link.

# Application Requirements
Develop a full stack application similar to the sample given in the video found in Week 11. 
The application should maintain records of dogs for adoption by the city veterinary office.

## Admin Account
The application should allow, creating/adding, viewing, updating and deleting of dog record/s.
